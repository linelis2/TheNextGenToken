"description": "TNGT is a two-phase token project. In phase 1, an initial supply of 1 billion tokens is released, and the goal is for these tokens to spread across as many wallets as possible through user buying and selling. This wide distribution is crucial for the success of phase 2. After a token swap, the phase 2 token will start with a supply of 1,000 tokens and will be mined over 30 years, with a maximum supply of 1 million tokens. The project features GameFi NFTs that unlock rewards and help safeguard against price dumping.",
